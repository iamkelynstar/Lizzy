  <section class="white-section" id="Argument">

  <h3 class="argument">My Argument Section.</h3>
  <p>Epistle writings haven't really been a problem for me over time because there's always a desire for me to express myself.</p>
  <p>Sometime last year, on top your matter üòõ, I typed out a 5 paged argument saying every single thing I had to say. My plan was to print it out and send to you but you cancelled our appointmentüê±.</p>
  <p>Anyways, here we are again. Its like we never actually left.</p>
  <p>The essence of all these is to tell your dumbass how exactly I feel. Okay so, my job as a manager has been genuine yhh( cuz i always wanted to be certain you were okay) but then it was also a means to remain close to you. Its so annoying how I'll be acting like an ode, an agbayaüòè. I like you. I want you but I won't express myself until one cute yoruba boy would come and carry you and I'll be cursing myself because I failed to make a move sooner. tch</p>
  <p>I made it a thing of high importance to reach out every day to hear from you. But things didn't always go as I planned sadly and it occured to me that I finally had to stop hiding and start being honest and here I am. </p>
  <p>I can't really say I know what your feelings are at the moment but I am acting on impulse knowing your liberty is quite scary because I know I can be late again in just a blink of an eye and I wouldn't like that awful repitition. So yhh I would create a comment box where you could tell me how you feel in your own words. </p>
  <p>You once said, you wanted us to try and take a step back for us to see if we could actually move forward(p.s. those weren't the exact words but that was the translation). I just want to let you know that even if things don't go my way, then it is not the end of the road for us because I won't stop hanging around unless you make it plainly clear you want nothing to do with me. That is frankly your only exit route. </p>
  <p>I don't want to pressure or rush you. I don't also want to make this all awkward but I needed to talk before it was too late again. I am super sorry if my statements rn put you in a tight corner. I'm sorry. Its just me being super straightforward and honest.</p>
  <p>If given the chance, I would want to build something amazing. Which brings me to the building part. I'm here and you're there. Wow, is there hope? Definitely. Would it be easy? Not exactly. But could it be worth it? Only time would tell. I see distance ruining a lot of beautiful things for people but the funny thing is that not all applications are the same. Pretty same way people are different. If you fully decide to chase after something important then there's almost no extent you wouldn't go to actually get it or make the kini work. Its all about the zeal and how important what you are chasing is. And heads up, you are very much special for me to let yeye distance prevail. Irrespective of the excesses of distance wahala, there are a couple advantages yunno. I'll start with your academics. I am not the type of person to be carried away completely and I would want the same for my girl. It was actually made easier because you are there and I am here. The whole distraction kini is minimized by a lottt and then at the end of the day, we would both be smiling on seeing the outcome cuz I sabi say you be agba, scholar aye, efiko 1.0üôå üòπ. </p>
  <p>Up next is the fact that a lot of relationships out there can't endure without the physical approach and existence. But in our case, it'll be something that could strengthen us further. There are guys out there like myself chasing something stable and special, but compare that to what we have around us today. What guy would actually agree to a type of relationship where he would see his girl just once or twice in a calendar year. I'm that type of guy, not because I wont want to see her but due to the situation of things. But would I let it stop me from trying to make it work, NO!. Why? Because I actually love her a lot.  </p>
  <p>Let's not forget she would end up missing me more because my face becomes super rare. And when you're opportuned to see boo then it would be a cute n special moment to cherish. Sorry I'm talking like you already said yes but then I can already picture some things. Lmao! I'm seeing you crying, Please don't go nawwwwww, Pleaseee!!üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ</p>
  <p>Also yh, partners away from eachother actually creates an avenue to get to know eachother better(exactly what you suggested months ago. Its actually coming in handy now. Sleek!). If warranted, Its that type of connection I want to build. Sadly I didnt understand your perspective earlier. I was a big jerk. I just assumed I was overly choking and you wanted to leave me alone. Moving forward, I just went online to look for something to back up my argument and I saw this "You are less likely to confuse lust with love. Attraction in a long-distance relationship tends to be based primarily on a foundation of emotional intimacy and shared values rather than physical intimacy. Being attracted to someone mostly because of the conversations you have (rather than the sex you share) is not an iron-clad guarantee of long-term relationship success, but it certainly helps.". It further justifies my claim and the probabibilty of success if given a Goüí™. I can't type out all the other positives of this long distance relationship kini so I'll add the link here in case you're a bit moved and you want to know more ways this could go right.</p>
  <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-ways-being-long-distance-relationship-can-actually-good-for-you.html">Click me L</a>
  <p>Okay so I know you're tired of reading-ishh, so I'm rounding up soon.</p>
  <p>In presenting my case, I have told you how I feel, how I want to actually make it work and generally my attitude towards its possible success. A relationship intended to last actually would need work from both parties. Committment and trust are biggy factors needed too. A whole lot of efforts too. I told you sometime ago during our previous ride that I was going to come around to see you. Given the right reasons,time and condition of things, I'd love to make that a reality but its phase by phase and tbh I haven't gone past the first phase cuz all these could crumble when Elizabeth says <em>NO!</em> üòì. But let's not forget I said I wasn't giving up. Remember that.</p>
  <p>My concluding note is me telling you not to rule me out completely. A leap of fate wouldn't be a bad idea yunno. We didn't have the best of histories but don't judge me now based on how I was before. It takes losing something important to know the value of things. I'm a person with an adjusted mindset, a cuter face and a mature relationship. I want to be your sweetheartüò≠.</p>
  <p>Yh I know I already concluded but Val is on Sunday. I never really really really was a val person but then, irrespective of how things play out with your reply then I'd want to book you for #Feb 14 2k22. Who exactly can tell what happens in a year time but let's see. (a couple of reasons why this year's own is a question mark for me and you too so i'm telling you in advance, a year time ‚ù§Ô∏è.)</p>
  <p>So happy you read this far, we'll meet in the section belowüëá. Thank You Lüëè</p>
